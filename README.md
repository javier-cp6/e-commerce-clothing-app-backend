# ðŸ‘•ðŸ›’ðŸ’³ Full-stack e-commerce app for a clothing store | Back end

This repository contains the back end section of a full-stack project for an e-commerce app ([Demo](https://cod-dwf-custom-clothing-app.vercel.app)).

The [front end](https://github.com/javier-cp6/e-commerce-clothing-app) built with ReactJS and deployed on Vercel displays products, categories, favorites, and a shopping cart. 

On the other hand, the [back end](https://github.com/javier-cp6/e-commerce-clothing-app-backend) was developed using NodeJS, Express and a MySQL database, and deployed on Heroku. Besides, the app integrates card payments through [Mercado Pagoâ€™s Checkout Pro](https://www.mercadopago.com/developers/en/docs/checkout-pro/landing).
